# Trello Clone Fullstack Project

This project is a Trello clone developed using Vue.js for the client-side and Express.js for the server-side. It allows users to create boards, lists, and cards to manage tasks and projects effectively. Below are the instructions to set up and run the project.

## Project Structure

The project consists of two main folders:

- **client**: Contains the client-side codebase developed using Vue.js and associated technologies.
- **server**: Contains the server-side codebase developed using Express.js and associated technologies.

## Client Side Technologies

The client-side of this project is built using the following technologies:

- Vue.js: A progressive JavaScript framework for building user interfaces.
- Vue Router: The official router for Vue.js.
- Pinia: A Vue.js store (state management) inspired by Vuex but offering better TypeScript integration.
- TypeScript: A strongly-typed superset of JavaScript.
- Vue Draggable: A Vue.js drag-and-drop plugin.
- PrimeVue: A UI component library for Vue.js.
- Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs.

## Server Side Technologies

The server-side of this project is built using the following technologies:

- Express.js: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework.
- pg: A non-blocking PostgreSQL client for Node.js.
- Sequelize: A promise-based Node.js ORM for PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB, SQLite, and Microsoft SQL Server.
- JSON Web Token (JWT): A compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties.
- TypeScript: A strongly-typed superset of JavaScript.

## Setup Instructions

### Client Setup

1. Navigate to the `client` directory.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Create a `.env` file based on `.env.example` and configure it accordingly.
4. Run the development server using `npm run dev`.

### Server Setup

1. Navigate to the `server` directory.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Create a `.env` file based on `.env.example` and configure it accordingly.
4. Run the server using `npm run start`.

## Additional Notes

- Ensure that PostgreSQL is installed and running on your system before starting the server.
- Make sure to configure the environment variables properly for both client and server.
- The project utilizes TypeScript for type safety and better code maintainability.
- Contributions are welcome. Feel free to open issues or submit pull requests.
